# Algorithm Visualizer

## Introduction

A small Python project done long ago during my early stage of learning Python.

It visualizes the following algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Heap Sort
5. Quick Sort

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the necessary packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Run the Programme

```bash
python algorithm_visualizer.py
```

### Manual
Once the program starts, click the buttons on the control panel located on the right-hand side of the screen, or use the shortcuts labeled on the buttons.

If you want to switch to another algorithm during sorting, press R or click the reset button.
